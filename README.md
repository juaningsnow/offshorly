Since the project needs to be done fast, I have used whats already in laravel packages.

This is the first time I used Inertia JS packet since its included as a starter kit on Laravel 9, as it turned out, the app does not use API.

Please advise if you want me to create another branch where I would build an API for CRUD.

Thanks!
